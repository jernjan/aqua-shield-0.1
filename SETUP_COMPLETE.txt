## 📂 What's inside

✨ **Complete, minimal MVP for Norwegian aquaculture alerts:**

📱 Frontend (React + Vite):
  • Login/Register page
  • Site selection (search BarentsWatch facilities + AIS vessels)
  • Dashboard with alert inbox (red/yellow/green)
  • Toast notifications

🔧 Backend (Node/Express):
  • JWT authentication
  • Nightly cron job (03:00) for risk analysis
  • Distance-weighted risk algorithm (0-100 score)
  • SMS/Email template stubs (ready for Twilio/Gmail)
  • JSON database (expandable to Postgres)

📊 Risk Engine:
  • Lice load + nearby disease + temp + current + boat traffic
  • Threshold: 60+ = RED alert, 40+ = YELLOW warning
  • Species-specific (salmon, trout, cod, etc.)

🚀 Deployment ready:
  • render.yaml for 1-click Render setup
  • DEPLOY.md with step-by-step instructions
  • .env.example with all secrets
  • Git-ready (.gitignore)

📚 Documentation:
  • README.md – Full overview
  • QUICKSTART.md – 5-minute local setup
  • DEPLOY.md – Render deployment guide
  • NOTES.md – Future improvements (seasons 1–3)
  • ARCHITECTURE.md – Technical structure

## 🚀 Next steps

### Local testing (now):
```bash
cd aqua-shield-0.1
cd server && npm install && npm run dev     # Terminal 1
cd client && npm install && npm run dev     # Terminal 2
# Open http://localhost:5173 → register, test alert
```

### Deploy (1–2 hours):
1. Push to GitHub
2. Create Render account
3. Follow DEPLOY.md (Web Service + Static Site)
4. Set env vars (JWT_SECRET, optional Twilio/Gmail)

### Pilot (3–6 months):
1. Contact 10–20 farmers + boat operators
2. Run nightly for 3 months FREE
3. Collect feedback: which alerts are correct? Which false?
4. Calibrate thresholds based on real outbreaks
5. Launch pricing: 4,000 kr/month per facility, 10,000 kr/month per boat fleet

## 🎯 Key features

✅ Open data only (no licenses)
✅ Rules-based, not ML (explainable)
✅ Multi-species support (salmon, trout, cod, etc.)
✅ Boat-to-facility warnings (AIS + disease tracking)
✅ Nightly automatic analysis
✅ Personal filtering (users see only their sites)
✅ Test alert button (for validation)
✅ Ready for SMS/Email (stubs in place)

⚠️ MVP limitations:
- No real SMS/Email yet (code ready, needs Twilio/Gmail setup)
- Temperature/current = mock data (needs weather API)
- Algae detection = not yet (needs Copernicus)
- Database = JSON-file (ok for <50 users, scale to Postgres)

---

## 💡 Suggestions for improvement (all in NOTES.md):

Season 1 (critical):
  1. Real SMS sending (Twilio)
  2. Nightly optimization (batch processing)
  3. PostgreSQL migration
  4. User feedback loop (was this alert correct? Y/N)

Season 2 (important):
  5. Admin panel (adjust thresholds live)
  6. Real temperature data (NorKyst-800)
  7. Real water current data
  8. Algae detection (Copernicus Sentinel)
  9. PDF export (detailed risk reports)

Season 3 (nice-to-have):
  10. Error logging (Sentry)
  11. Analytics dashboard
  12. WebSocket real-time alerts
  13. English/multi-language
  14. Mobile app (React Native)

---

## 📊 Pricing model (after MVP)

Facility subscription: 4,000 kr/month
Boat fleet subscription: 10,000 kr/month
Research/student: FREE

Target year 1: 20–50 customers = 10–30 mill kr ARR

---

## ⚡ Deploy estimate

Local setup: 5 min
Render deployment: 20 min
Total: <1 hour to live on web

---

## 📞 Quick reference

README.md – What is AquaShield? How it works?
QUICKSTART.md – How do I run it locally?
DEPLOY.md – How do I deploy to Render?
ARCHITECTURE.md – Technical structure & data flow
NOTES.md – What's next?

---

## ✨ Ready!

Everything is clean, self-contained, and documented in Norwegian.

No mix with previous Luse-Varsel code – this is a fresh start for a production MVP.

Next action: Follow QUICKSTART.md, test locally, then DEPLOY.md for Render.

Good luck! 🐟
